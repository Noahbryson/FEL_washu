## Changes 9/1/23
- Changed FEL parm generators w/ and w/o eyetracking to get local userPath to the BOX drive rather than having it hardcoded. 
	- This will allow for this script to be run on any machine with box desktop installed (that has access to the FEL folder ofc). 
	- tested on a windows machine, will need to verify on Unix machines.
